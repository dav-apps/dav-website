		<h3 class="font-weight-light mb-2">Information you provide</h3>
		<p>
			When you use our services you will be asked to provide specific information about you, like your email address.

		<h3 class="font-weight-light mb-2">Data shared with third parties</h3>
		<p>
			In order to be able to offer our services, it is necessary that we use certain services from third parties.
			The services with which data is shared are listed below.

		<p>
			However, these services are only used when it is necessary for our services to work. 
			Your data will not be sold or otherwise disclosed to third parties.

			You can download, view and delete all of your data in the settings of your account.

		<h4 class="font-weight-light mb-2">Payments</h4>

			If you upgrade to Plus or Pro, we share your email with Stripe in order to connect your payment information with your account.
			Your payment information will be stored directly by Stripe, which means we do not have access to your payment information.
			For more information, we reference to the <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="blank">Privacy Policy of Stripe</a>.

			or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
